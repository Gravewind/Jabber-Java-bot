This confernence bot using Smack libraries v3.2.2
Wroten based on the Leks13 Jabber Bot 1.0 at the beginning of 2012, since there wasn't any conference functionality that time.
Since bot specified for russian conferences, most of commands and comments are russian.
In case you need english version just ask for it. Elseway I will do it sometimes ~~very much~~ later.
Also, now it's not a ready-to-compile bot, but more like sandbox to let you implement whatever you wish.

Bot able to:
- reconnect
- roll dices
- execute commands
- reply
