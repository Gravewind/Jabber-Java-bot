This confernence bot using Smack libraries v3.2.2
First version was based on the Leks13 Jabber Bot 1.0 at the beginning of 2012, since there wasn't any conference functionality that time.
Second was in 2014, but no one really cares.
Since bot specified for russian conferences, most of commands and comments are russian.
In case you need english version just ask for it. Elseway I will do it sometimes ~~very, very~~ later.
Also, now it's not a ready-to-compile bot, but more like sandbox to let you implement whatever you wish.

Bot able to:
- reconnect
- roll dices
- execute commands
- reply
